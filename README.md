# CSS-HTML

This repository is where I experiment with creating front-end designs for websites using CSS and HTML. It also contains courses I've done.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project.
- `styles/`: A folder containing all CSS files for the project.
- `images/`: A folder containing all image files used in the project.
Some of the follders can differ depending on how old thier are.

## Design Gallery

Check out the [Design Gallery](https://github.com/<username>/css-html-playground/tree/main/design-gallery) folder to see some of the designs I have created.
